<h1>Responsive Web Design Projects</h1>

<p>FreeCodecamp(https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a nonprofit organization helping thousands of people learn to code for free. This repository captures my solutions to responsive web design projects.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>These projects are made for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. The objective was to use HTML and plain CSS in order to build five responsive webpages that fulfill freeCodeCamp's user stories. You can find further information on the projects in the links below.</p>
